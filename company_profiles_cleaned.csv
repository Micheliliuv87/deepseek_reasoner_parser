Initially  at a cost of US$100 million the project included the construction of four gas compressor stations  a processing plant to recover Propane  Butane and Naphtha  and a storage area at Sitra.  Due to a substantial increase in the quantity of associated gas extracted from the Bahrain Oil Field  an Expansion Project was launched in 1988 to upgrade plant processing capacity from 170 to 280 MMSCFD. The Project  which was implemented by the Government of Bahrain as a sole venture  involved construction of two additional compressor stations and a new processing train at the Central Gas Plant. The Project was commissioned in October 1990.  BANAGAS is certified to international standards ISO 9001:2008 (“Quality Management System )  OHSAS 18001:2007 (“Occupational Health and Safety Management ) and ISO 14001:2004 (“Environmental Management System ).

Medeniyetin gerektirdiği su/atık su  elektrik  iletişim  doğal gaz  vb. altyapılarının en ekonomik maliyet ve en azami hizmet ömrü ile insanlara ulaştırılması son derece hayati bir uğraştır.  Altyapı imalatlarının yüksek standartlara haiz olması en birincil hedef olarak değerlendirilmelidir. Bunun için planlama ve projelendirme safhalarından başlayarak malzeme ve işçilik kalitelerinin izlenebilirliği ile denetlenebilirliği büyük önem arz etmektedir.  Şehirleşmenin her geçen gün artmakta olduğu ülkemizde  eskiyen altyapıların yerine açık kazı ile yeniden altyapı yapılması şehir yaşamına hem sosyolojik hem de ticari açıdan pek çok sıkıntı getirmektedir. Yeniden harcanması gereken yüksek meblağlar ise cabası olmaktadır.  Dünya genelinde gelişme gösteren kazısız teknolojiler ile şehir yaşamını olumsuz etkilemeden ve yüksek meblağlı harcamalar gerektirmeden söz konusu eskiyen altyapılar yenilenebilmektedir.  Bilhassa yüksek deprem riski ile karşı karşıya olan ülkemizde  muhtemel bir depremin şehirlerimizdeki mevcut yıllanmış altyapıların çökmesine yol açabileceği  dolayısıyla kazısız teknolojiler ile güçlendirilebilecek altyapıların depremin olumsuz etkisini asgariye indirebileceği ve afet sonrası halkın su/atık su  elektrik  iletişim  doğal gaz  vb. ihtiyaçlarını kesintiye uğramadan devam ettirmesine yardımcı olacağı düşünülmektedir.  ABD  Almanya  İngiltere  Fransa  Japonya başta olmak üzere pek çok gelişmiş ülkede yaygın şekilde uygulanmakta olan kazısız teknolojilerin ülkemiz genelinde de tanınırlığını ve uygulanırlığını artırmak hedefiyle yola çıkan derneğimiz  ülkemizden ve dünya genelinden pek çok akademisyen  yönetici  mühendis ve uzman kişiler ile hedefine doğru emin adımlarla ilerlemektir. ,

土耳其,Turkey,Etki Liman İşletmeleri A.Ş.,Organization,2016.0,11-50,Etki Liman İşletmeleri A.Ş.,Nüfus artışı ve sanayileşmeye bağlı olarak artan enerji ihtiyacının karşılanmasında alternatif bir enerji kaynağı olan doğal gazın  şehirlerde gittikçe yoğunlaşan hava kirliliğine bir çözüm bulmak amacıyla 1970’lerde kullanımına başlanmıştır. Enerji talebindeki artışa paralel olarak sahip olduğu avantajlar nedeniyle kullanım oranı ve kullanım alanları giderek artan doğal gaz  Ülkemize ilk olarak 1987 yılında ithal edilmiştir.  Doğal gazın hacmi  soğutularak -163 oC’de sıvılaştırıldığında yaklaşık 600 kat küçültülmekte ve sıvı halde saklanabilmektedir. Böylece boru hatları ile taşımanın teknik ve ekonomik anlamda mümkün olmadığı mesafelere ve deniz aşırı ülkelere  gemilerle taşımaya uygun hale gelmektedir. Dünyada uluslararası ilk LNG kargosu ihracatı 1965 yılında Cezayir’den İngiltere ye yapılmıştır. LNG üreten ve denizaşırı ihracat yapan ülkelerin sayısı 1996 yılında sadece 8 iken  günümüzde bu sayı 25’ten fazladır.  Özellikle kış döneminde pik doğal gaz tüketim talebinin 250 milyon m3 seviyelerine ulaştığı Ülkemizde  önümüzdeki dönemde ekonomimizin büyümesine bağlı olarak talebin de artacağı öngörülmektedir. LNG ithal eden ülkeler arasında 8. sırada bulunan Ülkemizin  önümüzdeki 10 yıllık dönemde artması kaçınılmaz görünen doğal gaz talebinin karşılanması için ilave LNG ithal etmesi gerekmektedir. LNG ithalatı için gerekli fiziki altyapıların bugünden oluşturulması  doğal gazın arz esnekliği ve arz güvenliği açısından hayati önem taşımaktadır.  Bu kapsamda ETKİ Liman İşletmeleri Doğalgaz İthalat ve Ticaret A.Ş. tarafından İzmir İli  Aliağa İlçesi  Çakmaklı Köyü  Kızılburun Mevkii nde  yüksek güvenlik standartlarına uygun Yüzen Sıvılaştırılmış Doğal Gaz Depolama ve Gazlaştırma Terminali inşası tamamlanarak   gemilerle ithal edilen Sıvılaştırılmış Doğal Gazın  Yüzen Depolama ve Gazlaştırma Ünitesi (FSRU) ile yeniden gazlaştırılıp ulusal gaz hattına iletimi amacıyla  devreye alınmıştır.,www.etkiliman.com.tr

阿联酋,United Arab Emirates,ATOM Alloys,Organization,2011.0,,ATOM Alloys,CHALLENGE Fuel lies at the heart of most explosions and fires. Fuel consumption is continually increasing world over without a corresponding increase in safety measures to address the perils. Fuel safety interventions have been largely limited to precautionary hazard warning systems and post incident mitigation measures  Therefore the risk has remained unchecked and grown with the consumption figures causing frequent widespread disasters in the form of explosions related to LPG  fuel transporters  military operations and terrorist activities.  According to Allianz Global Corporate & Speciality (AGCS) Fire & Explosions are  the top cause of loss around the world and have caused in excess of €14 billion worth of losses from 2013-18. They are responsible for more than half of the 20 largest non-natural catastrophe events during this period. Beyond this  costs associated with the impact of business interruption  (BI)  value of lives lost/affected and environmental damage can significantly add to the final loss total from fire and explosion incidents.  SOLUTION ATOM is a certified patented technological solution that addresses the flammability factor of hydrocarbon fuels. Through the scientific innovation of optimized fuel storage & transportation units  ATOM prevents the escalation of fuel  fire and oxygen - the three key elements - into an explosion.

阿联酋,United Arab Emirates,Al Nasser Holdings,Organization,1977.0,1001-5000,Al Nasser Holdings,ANH was the brain-child of Abdulla Nasser Huwaileel who foresaw the need for a soundly based local holding company to serve as a vehicle to develop new schemes and to handle all his diversified investments and interests at home and abroad. ANH was therefore established to participate in the local development programme and also to take advantage of the associated business opportunities.  ANH s rapid growth into new fields was achieved by its insistence on excellence in product and service which represented the foundation stone of the Group. The combination of the highest levels of efficiency and a tightly-knit team of professionals resulted in an overall level of service particularly in the petroleum industry  which competitors found difficult to match.      With this impetus  ANH began to fully implement its policy of vertical integration through the formation of new joint ventures in many fields. ANH soon established a prominent position in the commercial and petroleum sectors initially within the U.A.E. and later expanded its sphere of operation to include many Gulf states and countries in the middle east.   ANH  in the course of constantly re-assessing its strategies and corporate plans  decided in the early 80 s to pursue a diversification policy in order to reduce its total dependence on oil-based projects and services. This is now demonstrated in the multi-discipline companies operating within the Group  the details of which are explained below.  The diversification policy proved to be a wise move since a few years after its inception  oil prices in the international market witnessed unprecedented deterioration which resulted in reduced demand for petroleum services in the region. By that time  ANH had already initiated a major restructuring programme to acquire new skills and to execute a long term strategy that would ensure the continued growth of the Group.,
